What will be the motive for yhe app? 
=> maybe it will help a man to learn baraille easily or  you can prepare your notes or can just use it for fun.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now lets talk about the UI and features:
=> I want to make this app preety informative. So, what i really want to do is i will add some besic informations 
   about braille like history, use, etc.
=> I want to make it in two portions. One will be translater field where it will be divided in 2 field one will be
   a test area and anothe will be the result. areas and one can copy his brail translater after it is done.
   and the another one will be braille script area here you will write in brail lenguage. like we write in 
   different language and one can copy that too.
